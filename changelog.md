### 25th November 2020
Release day! The first release of this calculator.
It supports reverse Polish (postfix) calculation in full - but using infix mode will just return 0 every time.

### 6th December 2020
Some updates to the GUI, added a help menu, and...
*drumroll*
Standard notation calculation.

Hooray!

### 8th December 2020
Release of version 1.2

This includes an Ascii view, and so the program can now be run entirely in the command line.

It now compiles to Java8 (as opposed to 11 previously) to make it easier for users to run with the readily-available
Oracle JRE.
